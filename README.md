NAME
====

Native::Overflow - lexically enforce overflow checking on natives

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use Native::Overflow <int8>;

my int16 $a = 1_000_000;  # no overflow check
say $a;  # 16960

my int8 $b = 1000;
# Type check failed in assignment to $c; expected int8 but got Int (100)

# Only override in scope
{
    use Native::Overflow;
    my int16 $c = 1_000_000;
    # Type check failed in assignment to $c; expected int16 but got Int (1000000)
}
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

`Native::Overflow` provides a number of `subsets` with the same names as built-in native types that provide overflow checking (which native types do **not** perform by design).

It is mostly intended as a debugging tool, as usage will thwart any efficiency gains of using real native integer variables.

By default the `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`, `uint64`, `uint32`, `uint16`, `uint8`, `byte` subsets are imported.

The `int1`, `int2` `int4`, `uint4`, `nibble`, `uint2`, `uint1`, `bit` subsets can be optionally imported (these may at one point become available as native types in Raku).

Inspired by [a Rakudo issue](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/1725).

BUGS
====

Apparently some issue in Rakudo in release 2024.09 and earlier is causing the handling of `int32`, `int64`, `uint64` and `uint32` to fail.

Another issue in the new Raku grammar (aka RakuAST) is causing this module to fail completely at import.

It is hoped that these issues will be resolved in the future.s
